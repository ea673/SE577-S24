# ADR 002: High Level Architecture
Per (ADR-001)[adr-001.md], we will be deploying the new back-end application in the cloud. We need to decide on a high level architecture that is appropriate for the cloud.

Options considered: 
* Horizontally scalable monolith
* Modular monolith
* Microservices with single separate API Gateway

## Decision 
We will be using a modular monolith architecture.

## Rationale 
We've made the decision to use a modular monolith architecture with the expectation that it will eventually be converted into a microservices architecture. Having boundaries between the different components will aid in this transition. However, by initially developing in a monolithic way, that enables higher velocity in development and easier management of deployments and infrastructure as we become more familiar with deploying applications in the cloud.

## Status
[Proposed]
If deprecated, indicate why. If superseded, include a link to the new ADR. 

## Consequences
* Faster development time
* Easier deployment management
* More prone to failure than completely independent modules/services
* Not as simple to scale up/down individual components, although still doable.
