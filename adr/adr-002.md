# ADR 002: High Level Architecture
Per [ADR-001](adr-001.md), we will be deploying the new back-end application in the cloud. We need to decide on a high level architecture that is appropriate for the cloud. The solution needs to be scalable, highly-available and also quick to market.

Options considered: 
* Horizontally scalable monolith
* Modular monolith
* Microservices with single separate API Gateway

## Decision 
We will be using a modular monolith architecture.

## Rationale 
We've made the decision to use a modular monolith architecture with the expectation that it will eventually be converted into a microservices architecture. Having boundaries between the different components will aid in this transition. However, by initially developing in a monolithic way, that enables higher velocity in development and easier management of deployments and infrastructure as we become more familiar with deploying applications in the cloud.

## Status
[Proposed]

## Consequences
* Faster development time
* Easier deployment management
* More prone to failure than completely independent modules/services
* While still possible, it's not as simple to scale up/down individual components in response to demand.
